Here are the important points from the text:

1. HTML video and audio tags are used to embed media on a webpage.
2. The video tag supports file types such as MP4, WebM, and OGG, while the audio tag supports file types like MP3, WAV, and OGG.
3. To add a video, you start with the video tag and then add a source element within it. The source element has attributes like src (address of the video file) and type (file type).
4. If the web browser doesn't support the specified file type, you can provide multiple sources in different formats, and the browser will use the first supported format.
5. Attributes like width and height can be used to customize the video player's dimensions, and the controls attribute enables player controls like pause and volume buttons.
6. Similar to the video tag, the audio tag is used to embed audio. You specify the source element with src and type attributes, and fallback types can be specified for unsupported file types.
7. The controls attribute can be used to enable player controls for the audio player.
8. Customization options are available for both the video and audio players, and more attributes will be covered in a later video.

These points explain how to add videos and audio to a webpage using HTML and how to customize the player controls and appearance.
