Client-side validation in HTML can be used to guide users in entering correct data and save web server resources.
Error messages in online forms can occur due to incorrect format, empty fields, or values that are too long or too short.
The "required" attribute can be added to form fields to ensure that the user provides a value. If a required field is empty and the submit button is clicked, the request will not be submitted to the web server.
The "minlength" and "maxlength" attributes can be used to specify the required length for data. For example, a username may need to be between 3 and 12 characters, and a password may need to be at least 5 characters long.
CSS can be used to visually communicate errors to users. The "input:invalid" selector can be used to select elements with invalid input, and a CSS property can be applied to set the border color to red.
By adding the "input:focus:invalid" pseudo-class, the field will only turn red when the user is actively entering data into that field, improving the user experience.
Using client-side validation and CSS pseudo-class selectors can greatly enhance the user experience of forms.
More advanced techniques for form validation can be explored using JavaScript in future courses.
These points summarize the benefits and techniques of client-side validation in HTML, including ensuring required values, specifying length requirements, and using CSS to visually communicate errors to users.
