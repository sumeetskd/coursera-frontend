Important points from the provided information:

1. The person is building an application using React and wants to add a new feature to render images.

2. The process involves embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute, specifically the SRC attribute of the HTML image tag.

3. The user has an App.js file in a new project and starts with an app component that returns an h1 header text, "hello world."

4. To use the image (avatar.png) in the app, the user imports it into the app component.

5. The user then adds a new function named "logo" inside the App.js file, which is essentially a separate component to render the image.

6. Inside the "logo" function, a JSX element for the image is created, and the imported avatar.png image is passed as the value for the SRC attribute.

7. The "logo" function returns the JSX element containing the image.

8. Back in the app component, the "logo" component is rendered by adding the logo element inside the app component's return statement.

9. The app is previewed in the browser, showing the header text along with the image.

10. The user notes that for a more organized structure, it would be best to extract the "logo" component to its own file and import/render it as needed.

11. The video demonstrates how to embed a JSX expression in an attribute, specifically the SRC attribute of an HTML image tag, to display the image in the React app.
