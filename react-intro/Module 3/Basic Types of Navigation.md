Important points from the text:

1. Early web development lacked design standards, leading to experimental approaches.

6. Mega menu is a drop-down navigation menu used on e-commerce and content-heavy sites.
7. Complex navigation UI can combine multiple navigation approaches in a single component.
8. React navigation works differently from traditional HTML and CSS navigation, as the entire app is loaded inside a single div, and the content is controlled by React through the virtual DOM.
9. React's navigation gives the impression of visiting different URLs by updating the view or loading new views based on virtual DOM changes.
10. React's navigation is compared to the buttons inside an elevator; pressing a button loads a new floor's construction into a single floor of an "impossible building."
11. To achieve the illusion of a multi-page website in React, developers need to use the React router library.
