Sure, here are the important points from the provided transcript:

1. The video demonstrates various ways of displaying images in a React app.
2. Three different methods are covered for displaying images in a React app:
   a. Using the import statement and providing a relative path.
   b. Using the require function to set the file path.
   c. Providing an image URL.
3. A basic app called "Embedded Assets" is used to demonstrate working with embedded assets.
4. The app's source folder contains an assets folder, which includes an image folder.
5. A JPEG image named "Central Park" is added to the images folder.
6. The code of the app component is shown by clicking on the "app.js" file.
7. The task is to display three images with styling.
8. **First Method (Import Statement):**
   - Import the image file "Central Park" using `import rooftops from "./assets/images/Central Park.jpg"`.
   - Render the image using an `<img>` tag with a height attribute of 200 pixels.
   - Set the source attribute to the imported image (`src={rooftops}`) and include an alt attribute for description.
9. **Second Method (Require Function):**
   - Create an `<img>` tag and limit its height to 200 pixels.
   - Set the source attribute to `require("./assets/images/Central Park.jpg")`.
   - Include an alt attribute for description.
   - The image is required using the relative path, without the need for import.
10. **Third Method (Image URL):**
    - Create a variable: `const randomImageURL = "URL of a random image"`.
    - Include a new image element in the return statement with `src={randomImageURL}`.
11. The video concludes by highlighting the three different ways to use image assets in a React component.
