Important points from the provided text:

1. JSX in React allows developers to express what they want to render using a syntax similar to HTML or XML. JSX allows developers to write HTML directly inside JavaScript code.

2. JSX expressions can include variables and props, making it powerful and flexible to use.

3. JSX expressions are written inside curly braces and can contain any kind of JavaScript code.

4. The return statement in a component is where JSX is used to write regular HTML code to be rendered in the app. If the HTML code spans multiple lines, it should be placed inside parentheses.

5. HTML code in the return statement must be wrapped in a top-level element, like a div tag, or you can use a fragment to avoid adding unnecessary div elements.

6. In JSX, to work with CSS classes, the keyword "class" cannot be used due to it being a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Instead, the "className" attribute should be used in Camel Case to specify CSS classes for styling JSX elements.

7. The code written in the return statement of a component is like regular HTML but with some differences due to being in a JavaScript file.

8. JSX provides a way to style React apps using CSS classes, and there are multiple ways to achieve styling, which will be covered later.

9. The text concludes by acknowledging that the code in JSX is similar to regular HTML and CSS, making it easy for developers familiar with web development to work with React components and styling.
