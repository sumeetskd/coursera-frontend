**Lifting state up is about cutting the state from the child component and moving it to the parent component's code, with the intent of making the state available in sibling components.** 

Title: Managing State in React Applications

**Introduction**
- As React applications grow in complexity, managing state across components becomes challenging.
- State management is crucial for handling data that is likely to change in the application.

**Scenario: Food Intake Monitoring App**
- Illustrates a small React app to promote a healthier lifestyle by monitoring food intake.
- The app tracks a daily meal plan, and users can mark consumed meals.
- The app consists of three components: App.js, mealsList, and counter.

**The Issue: Sibling Components and State**
- The counter component needs state information from the mealsList component.
- Both components are rendered by the App component, making them siblings, not parent-child.
- The challenge is passing state information between sibling components.

**Solution: Lifting State Up**
- Simplify the mealsList component by extracting the returned value into its own component (mealItem).
- Practice known as "lifting state up" involves moving state from mealsList to the App component.
- Pass state down to mealItem component via props, enabling the counter component to access the state.

**Challenge: Prop Drilling**
- Prop drilling refers to passing props through multiple layers of components to access data.
- If source data changes, updates must be transferred throughout the prop drilled structure.
- Complicates state updates for child components and their siblings.

**Issues with Centralized State in App Component**
- As the app grows, there can be a large amount of state stored in the App component.
- Most of this state should belong to components such as mealItem, not the top-level App component.

**The Context API: An Elegant Solution**
- The Context API allows for centralized state management, known as "global state."
- Eliminates the need for prop drilling and lifting state up.
- Components can directly access required data from the context without intermediary components.

**Implementation of Context API**
- State is extracted into a separate file, creating a centralized state store.
- Any component that needs the state can import and use it.
- Components can easily access global state without worrying about the component hierarchy.

**Conclusion**
- React's Context API provides a cleaner and more efficient way to manage global state.
- It simplifies state management in complex React applications and eliminates the issues of prop drilling and lifting state up.
- Proper state management is essential to ensure the app behaves as intended and stays in sync with the user's interactions.
