Here are the important points from the provided transcript about common programming errors and best practices to avoid them:

1. **Types of Errors:** Programming errors can be skill-based (typos and syntax errors), rule-based (not following coding rules), and knowledge-based (gaps in coding knowledge).

2. **Skill-based Errors:** These errors include typos, missing delimiters, quotation marks, and syntax errors. Clean code is the responsibility of the developer, even though some errors are flagged by modern code editors.

3. **Rule-based Errors:** Rule-based errors occur when developers don't follow coding rules, such as improper naming conventions or confusion with multiple properties that can accept similar values.

4. **Knowledge-based Errors:** Experienced coders may make errors due to gaps in their coding knowledge, using overly complex code that becomes hard to understand later.

5. **Best Practices to Avoid Errors:**
   - Use shorthand to simplify code and make it more readable.
   - Understand specificity in CSS to avoid misconfigurations and increase browser loading time.
   - Apply rules broadly over containers instead of specific elements to prevent over specificity.
   - Avoid redundancy of rules, selectors, and properties to prevent confusion.
   - Perform a CSS reset using a universal selector to remove browser-specific configurations before writing your code.

6. **Continuous Improvement:** The best way to avoid errors is to design more web pages and integrate good practices into your code gradually, which will lead to making fewer errors over time.

Remember that programming is a continuous learning process, and by implementing these best practices and gaining more experience, you can improve the quality of your code and minimize common errors.
