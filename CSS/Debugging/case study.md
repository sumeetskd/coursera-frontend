Here are the important points from the provided transcript about the importance of testing in app development:

1. **Importance of Testing:** Testing is essential to ensure that an application is of high-quality, reliable, and doesn't break. It gives confidence that the app works as intended and identifies problems early for easier fixes.

2. **Avoiding Future Issues:** Writing tests helps catch problems before they become major issues, preventing potential app failures or errors in the future.

3. **Unit Testing and End-to-End Testing:** Unit testing ensures specific functionalities, such as cryptography in messaging apps, work as expected. End-to-end testing involves running tests that interact with the browser automatically to ensure the entire app functions correctly.

4. **Responsibility of Everyone:** Testing is a shared responsibility. Product teams building apps should write tests to ensure stability, while the teams building test frameworks ensure high reliability for running tests before shipping code.

5. **Testing Bar for New Features:** To maintain a stable product, a testing bar is set where every new feature should have a few tests before release.

6. **Value of Testing:** Although testing may seem time-consuming initially, it is valuable as it saves time and prevents major issues in the future.

7. **Challenging Activity:** Writing good tests is a challenging activity that requires effort and attention to detail, just like building any product.

8. **Fundamental Skill:** Learning testing is a fundamental skill in a developer's career and will be beneficial for future projects and app development.

Overall, testing is a crucial aspect of app development that ensures high-quality and reliable applications for users' satisfaction. It is a responsibility shared across development teams, and investing time in writing good tests is essential for long-term success.
