Important points from the text:

1. **Animation with @keyframes**: To create complex animations in CSS, developers use the `animation` property in combination with the `@keyframes` rule. The `@keyframes` rule defines the keyframes for the animation, and the `animation` property links the animation to a specific keyframe rule.

2. **@keyframes Syntax**: The `@keyframes` rule specifies the animation's name and the individual keyframes. Each keyframe is defined with a keyframe selector and CSS styles for that keyframe. The optional keywords "from" and "to" can also be used to show transitions.

3. **Animation Property**: The `animation` property has subproperties like `animation-name`, `animation-delay`, etc. It can be set using shorthand syntax or individually, and some subproperties can be left out to use default settings.

4. **Example: Clock Animation**: An example of a clock animation is provided using the `animation` property and `@keyframes` rule. The hour and minute hands of the clock are animated to rotate seamlessly using the `transform` property.

5. **Endless Creativity**: CSS offers endless possibilities for animation. Developers can combine properties and rules creatively to achieve amazing animations, even using pure CSS without images or external resources.
