The important points from the provided text are:

1. Responsive web design is about building a product that works across various devices and viewports (mobile phones, desktop apps, tablets).
2. A responsive website adjusts its layout and functionality based on the viewport size.
3. Considerations for different viewports include placing important elements within reach (e.g., action buttons at the bottom for mobile devices) and being thoughtful about functionality placement.
4. The goal is to make the website work across a wide range of viewports rather than focusing on specific devices.
5. Considering the capabilities of the device being used to improve the user experience beyond just making it work.
6. Understanding how products make people feel and adapting to changes in user behavior and technology.
7. Maintaining quality and functionality through QA testing and adapting to technological changes (e.g., new screen resolutions).
8. The goal is to make the website always work across a range of dimensions rather than just ticking off device compatibility boxes.
9. Making the interface flexible and adaptable to different dimensions is more important than focusing on individual devices.
